# Stack and linked list tutorial

This project has been prepared for the data structures and algorithms course. The project consists of 3 parts

  - Sorting (by stack)
  - Hot Patato (by linked list)
  - Exit

# Sorting 

  - According to the figure below, 4 people numbered as 1,2,3,4 in a difficult terrain have a depth of 3. They pass through the pit. To ensure passage, the person in front of the pit as deep as the pit other people are safely passed through with their stroke. Then the last person to pass the pits pulls out in order. The ranking formed as a result of the transition is 4,3,2,1.
  - Question: Accordingly, the individuals numbered as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 are in  cukur.txt file, respectively. If they go through 1000 pits with given depths, what is the last ranking?

# Hot Patato 

  - At least 3 people for the game, you need a hot potato and music. A person turns the music on and off and is not active in the game. When music starts the game starts and the player with the hot potato passes it to the player next to him, as the potato burns. Potato changing hands continues until the music stops. The player who holds the potato in his hand when the music stops remains out of order. This continues until 1 player remains
  - Question: As shown in the figure below, throwing the potato in his hand to the player behind him again passes to the end of the tail. The playing time of the music is randomly selected in the range of 10-25 seconds. One the player's holding time of the potato is randomly selected between 1-3 seconds. The number of players must be 15. The status of the queue, the playing time of the music, the eliminated player, etc. for the pursuit of the game values every time should be printed on the screen.
